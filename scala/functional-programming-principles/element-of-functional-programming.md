# Elements of functional programming

- arithmetic and boolean expression

- conditional expression `if-else`

- function in recursion, especially [tail recursion](tail-recursion.md)

- nesting and lexical scope `{}`

The key points are:

- the difference between [call-by-value and call-by-name](call-by-value-vs-call-by-name.md)

- reduce expression by using the **substition model** (Î» - calculus)
