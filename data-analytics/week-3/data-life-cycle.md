# Data life cycle

The life cycle of data is **plan, capture, manage, analyze, archive and destroy**.

## Plan

During planning, a business decides:

- what kind of data it needs
- how it will be managed throughout its life cycle
- who will be responsible for it
- the optimal outcomes

## Capture

This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization.

## Manage

We need to consider:

- how we care for our data
- how and where it's stored
- the tools used to keep it safe and secure
- the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly.

## Analyze

In this phase, the data is used to **solve problems, make great decisions, and support business goals**.

## Archive

Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available, but may not be used again.

## Destroy

We destroy data for protecting a company's private information, as well as private data about its customers.
