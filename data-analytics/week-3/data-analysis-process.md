# Data analysis process

This program is split into courses, six of which are based upon the steps of data analysis: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act**.

## Act

In this phase, we do two things:

- define the problem to be solved

  You look at the **current state** and identify how it's different from the **ideal state**.

  Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed.

- make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations.

  Determine who the stakeholders are. That may include **your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners**.

  They help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about the project.

Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

## Prepare

This is where data analysts **collect and store data** they'll use for the upcoming analysis process.

## Process

Data analysts find and eliminate **any errors and inaccuracies** that can get in the way of results.

This usually means **cleaning data**, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers,

## Analyze

Analyzing the data you've collected involves **using tools to transform and organize that information** so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

## Share

Data analysts **interpret results and share them** with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions.

Visualization is a data analyst's best friend.

## Act
