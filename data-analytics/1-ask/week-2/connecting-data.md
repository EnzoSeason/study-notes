## Mathematical thinking

It means looking at a problem and logically **breaking it down step-by-step**, so you can see **the relationship of patterns** in your data, and use that to analyze your problem.

This kind of thinking can also help you figure out the best tools for analysis because it lets us see the **different aspects** of a problem and choose the best logical approach.

## Big and small data

### Small data

- Describes a data set made up of **specific metrics** over a **short, well-defined time period**

- Usually organized and analyzed in **spreadsheets**

- Likely to be used by small and midsize businesses

- Simple to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent

- Usually already a manageable size for analysis

### Big data

- Describes **large, less-specific** data sets that cover a **long time period**

- Usually kept in a **database and queried**

- Likely to be used by large organizations

- Takes a lot of effort to collect, store, manage, sort, and visually represent

- Usually needs to be broken into smaller pieces in order to be organized and analyzed effectively for decision-making

### The three (or four) V words for big data

They are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity.

- volume: The amount of data

- variety: The different kinds of data

- velocity: How fast the data can be processed

- veracity: The quality and reliability of the data
