## Solve problems with data

We're going to focus on six common types. These include:

1. making predictions
2. categorizing things
3. spotting something unusual
4. identifying themes
5. discovering connections
6. finding patterns

### Making predictions

This problem type involves using data to **make an informed decision** about how things may be **in the future**.

### Categorizing things

This means assigning information to **different groups or clusters** based on **common features**.

### Spotting something unusual

We identify data that is **different from the norm**.

### Identifying themes

Identifying themes takes categorization as a step further by **grouping information into broader concepts**.

### Discovering connections

The problem type of discovering connections enables data analysts to **find similar challenges faced by different entities**, and then **combine data and insights to address them**.

### Finding patterns

Data analysts use data to find patterns by using **historical data** to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again.
