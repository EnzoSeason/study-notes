## SMART questions

Some questions are more effective than others:

- **Specific**: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?

- **Measurable**: Does the question include a feature rating system?

- **Action-oriented**: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?

- **Relevant**: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?

- **Time-bound**: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?

### Specific questions

Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas.

This helps us collect information that's relevant to what we're investigating.

### Measurable questions

Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed.

### Action-oriented questions

Action-oriented questions encourage change.

Action-oriented questions helps **see the current state** and **figure out how to transform it into the ideal future state**.

### Relevant questions

Relevant questions matter, are important and **have significance to the problem you're trying to solve**.

### Time-bound questions

Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied.
