## Testing

### Statistical power

Statistical power is the probability of getting meaningful results from a test.

Usually, you need a statistical power of at least **0.8 or 80%** to consider your results **statistically significant**.

#### Statistically significant

If a test is statistically significant, it means the results of the test are **real and not an error caused by random chance**.

### Hypothesis testing

Hypothesis testing is a way to see if a survey or experiment has meaningful results.

### Confidence level

The confidence level is the probability that your sample accurately reflects the greater population.

Having a 99 percent confidence level is ideal. But most industries hope for **at least a 90 or 95 percent** confidence level.

### Sample size calculator

To calculate the sample size, we need, **population size, confidence level, margin of error**.

There are some terms you will come across when using a sample size calculator:

- **Confidence level**: The probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population.

- **Margin of error**: The maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population.

- **Population**: This is the total number you hope to pull your sample from.

- **Sample**: A part of a population that is representative of the population.

- **Estimated response rate**: If you are running a survey of individuals, this is the percentage of people you expect will complete your survey out of those who received the survey.

### Margin of error

The **maximum** amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population. More technically, the margin of error defines a range of values **below and above the average result** for the sample.

The closer to **zero** the margin of error, the closer your results from your sample would match results from the **overall population**.

So to calculate margin of error, you need three things:

- population size
- sample size
- confidence level.
