# Documenting

Documenting is the process of tracking **changes, additions, deletions and errors** involved in your data cleaning effort.

Having a record of how a data set evolved does three very important things.

- recover data-cleaning errors

- inform other users of changes you've made

- determine the quality of the data to be used in analysis

Documenting data-cleaning makes it possible to:

- be transparent about your process

- keep team members on the same page

- demonstrate to project stakeholders that you are accountable.
