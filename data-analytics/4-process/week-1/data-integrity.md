# Data integrity

Data integrity is the **accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness** of data throughout its lifecycle.

There's a chance data can be compromised every time it's **replicated, transferred, or manipulated** in any way.

- **Data replication** is the process of storing data in multiple locations.

  Different people might not be using the same data for their findings, which can cause **inconsistencies**.

- **Data transfer** is the process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another.

  You might end up with an **incomplete** data set.

- **Data manipulation** process involves changing the data to make it more organized and easier to read.

  The process can compromise the efficiency.

Data can also be compromised through **human error, viruses, malware, hacking, and system failures**.

## Alignment to business objective

1. Clean data + alignment to business objective = accurate conclusions

2. Alignment to business objective + **additional data cleaning** = accurate conclusions

3. Alignment to business objective + **newly discovered variables + constraints** = accurate conclusions
