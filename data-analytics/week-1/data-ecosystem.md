# Data Ecosystem

Data ecosystems are made up of **various elements that interact with one another** in order to **produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and share** data.

## Definition

### Data science

Data science is defined as creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.

### Data scientist vs Data analysts

- Data scientists **create new questions** using data.
- Data analysts **find answers to existing questions** by creating insights from data sources.

### Data analysis vs Data analytics

- Data analysis:

  Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making.

- Data analytics: the science of data

  It's a very broad concept that encompasses everything from the job of **managing and using data** to the **tools and methods** that data workers use each and every day.

##Â Data-driven decision-making

A data analyst:

1. gathers relevant **data**, analyzes it, and uses it to draw conclusions.
2. shares their analysis with **subject-matter experts**, who validate the findings.
3. make a plan to put it into **action**.

## Data and gut instinct

Gut instinct is an intuitive understanding of something with little or no explanation.

### Why gut instinct can be a problem

If you ignore data by preferring to make decisions based on your own experience, your decisions may be **biased**. But even worse, decisions based on gut instinct without any data to back them up can cause mistakes.

### Data + business knowledge = mystery solved

Blending data with business knowledge, plus maybe a touch of gut instinct, will be a common part of your process as a junior data analyst.
