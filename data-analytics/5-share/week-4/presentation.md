# Presentation

## Bussiness Task

The business task is the question or problem. your data analysis answers.

## Hypothesis

The **theory** you're trying to prove or disprove with data.

Establishing the hypothesis early in the presentation helps your audience understand data.

## The McCandless Method

1. Introduce the graphic by name

2. Answer obvious question before they're asked

3. State the insight of your graphic

4. Call out the data to support the insight

5. Tell your audience why it matters

## Good data presentation

Good presentation: people are logically guided through the data.

- Title and date the presentation was last updated

- Flow or table of contents

- Transition slides

- Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme)

- Animated bullet points

- Annotations on top of visuals

- Logic and progression

- Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data canâ€™t tell you

## Prestation tips

- Channel your excitement

  calm your body down before giving a presentation

- Start with the broader ideas

- Use the five second rule

  1.  wait for 5 seconds after showing a data visualization

  2.  ask if they understand, if not, explain the data visualization

  3.  give the audience another 5 second before telling them the conclusion

- Prepare well for the presentation

So, you need to

- keep your sentences short

- build in intentional pauses

- keep the pitch of your sentences level

And, be careful of nervous habits

- stay still and move with purpose
