# Q&A

## Before Q&A

First, you should

- Understand your stakehold's expectations

- Make sure you have a clear understading of the objective and what the stakeholders wanted

Then, you can start to **identify the possible audience questions**. You can:

- do a colleague test

  present to your colleague who has no knownledge about your project

- asume that your audience has zero background information of your project

- work with the team to anticipate questions and draft the answers

Finally, you should be prepared to consider any **limitaions of your data** by

- critically analyzing the correlations
- looking at the context
- understand the strengths and weekness of your tools

## Handling objections

The objections or questions could be:

- data

  - Where you got the data?

  - What system it came from?

  - What transformations happened to it?

  - How fresh and accurate is data?

- analysis

  - Is the analysis reproducible?

  - Who did you get the feedback from?

- findings

  - Do these findings exist in previous time periods?

  - Did you control for the differences in your data?

It's important to keep the **Changlogs** and **documents** during the analysis.

To reponse these:

- communicate any assumptions

- explain why the analysis is different than expected

- acknowledge that the objections are valid and take steps to investigate further

## Best practices

- Listen to the whole question

- Repeat the question if necessary

- Understand the context

- Involve the whole audience

- Keep your responses short and to the point
