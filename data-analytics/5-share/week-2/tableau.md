## Tableau

Tableau enables you to:

- observe and understand data to make decisions

- connect to data in databases, spreadsheets or CSV files

- create and share interactive **dashboards** with data

### Primary chart types

- **Column (vertical bar)**: a column chart allows you to display and compare multiple categories of data by their values.

- **Horizontal bar**: a bar chart functions similarly to a column chart, but is flipped horizontally.

- **Line**: a line chart showcases trends in your data over a period of time.

- **Pie**: a pie chart is an easy way to visualize what proportion of the whole each data point represents.

- **Area**: area charts allow you to track changes in value across multiple categories of data.

- **Scatter**: scatter plots are typically used to display trends in numeric data.

- **Combo**: combo charts use multiple visual markers like columns and lines to showcase different aspects of the data in one visualization.

### Data Type in Tableau

- **#**: Numeric data

- **Abc**: String data

- **Globe**: Geographic data

- **Calendar**: Date data

- **Calendar with a clock**: Date and time data

### Diverging color palette

A diverging color palette in Tableau displays characteristics of values using:

- Intensity for the magnitude
- Hue for the range

### What makes an effective visualization?

- **Five-second rule**: A data visualization should be **clear, effective, and convincing** enough to be absorbed in five seconds or less.

- **Color contrast**: Graphs and charts should use a **diverging color palette** to show contrast between elements.

- **Conventions and expectations**: Visuals and their organization should align with **audience expectations and cultural conventions**.

- **Minimal labels**: Titles, axes, and annotations should use as **few labels** as it takes to make sense.
