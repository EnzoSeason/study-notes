# Data validation

This process involves **checking and rechecking the quality of your data** so that it is **complete, accurate, secure, and consistent**.

## Types of data validation

1. Data type

   Check that the data matches the data type defined for a field.

2. Data range

   Check that the data falls within an acceptable range of values defined for the field.

3. Data contraints

   Check that the data meets certain conditions or criteria for a field. This includes the type of data entered as well as other attributes of the field, such as number of characters.

4. Data consistency

   Check that the data makes sense in the context of other related data.

5. Data structure

   Check that the data follows or conforms to a set structure.

6. Code validation

   Check that the application code systematically performs any of the previously mentioned validations during user data input.
