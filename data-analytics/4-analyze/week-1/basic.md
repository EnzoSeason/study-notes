# Data analysis basic

## 4 phases of analysis

1. Organize data

   collecting the data you need for analysis.

2. Format and adjust data

   Sorting and filtering

3. Get input from others

   soliciting information from other sources to inform your decisions.

4. Transform data

   Identifying relationships and patterns between the datasets and making calculations based on the data.

## Organizing data

Database organization enables analysts to make decisions about which data is relevant to pull for a specific analysis.

Database relationships are associations between tables.

## Sorting

Sorting sheet is used to **sort all data** in a spreadsheet by the ranking of **a specific sorted column**.

Sort Range enables a data analyst to select a specific collection of cells in order to limit the sorting to **just that range**.

### Excel

The sort from a spreadsheet's Data tab overwrites the cells containing the unsorted data with the sorted data, while a written SORT function inserts the sorted data in a different cell range.

The sort in the Data tab can also exclude a header row in the data range from being sorted, while the data range for a written SORT function should never contain a header row.

## SQL

use the keywords, `ORDRE BY` and `WHERE`.
