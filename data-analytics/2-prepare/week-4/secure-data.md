## Securing data

### Data security

Data security means protecting data from unauthorized access or corruption by adopting safety measures.

- **Encryption** uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don’t know the algorithm.

- **Tokenization** replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token.”

  The original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens.

  To access the complete original data, the user or application needs to have permission to use the tokenized data and the token mapping. This means that even if the tokenized data is hacked, the original data is still safe and secure in a separate location.
