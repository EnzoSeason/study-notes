## Organizing data

### Best practices

- Naming conventions

  - work out the conventions early
  - align file naming with the team
  - make sure they are meaningful
  - keep the name short and
  - format the date by `YYYYMMDD`
  - format the version leading by `0`, e.g. `v01`
  - Use `_`, `-` instead of space and special characters.

  For example, `SalesReport_2021_11_11_v02`

- Foldering

- Archiving old files

  To separate current from past work and reduce clutter

- Aligning your practices with your team

- Developping metadata
