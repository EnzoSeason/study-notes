## Bias

Bias has evolved to become **a preference in favor** of or against a person, group of people, or thing.

Bias can also happen if a sample group **lacks inclusivity**.

### Data bias

Data bias is a type of error that systematically **skews results in a certain direction**.

We'll explore three more types of data bias:

- sampling bias
- observer bias
- interpretation bias
- confirmation bias


#### Sampling bias

Sampling bias is when a sample **isn't representative of the population as a whole**.

A great way to discover if you're working with unbiased data is to **bring the results to life with visualizations**.


#### Observer bias

Observer bias is sometimes referred to as **experimenter bias or research bias**.

Basically, it's the tendency for **different people to observe things differently**.

#### Interpretation bias

It's the tendency to always **interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way**.

#### Confirmation bias

It's the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that **confirms preexisting beliefs**.
