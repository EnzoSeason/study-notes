## Ethics

Ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe **what humans ought to do**, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness or specific virtues.

## Data ethics

Data ethics refers to well-founded **standards of right and wrong** that dictate how data is **collected, shared, and used**.

There are lots of different aspects of data ethics but we'll cover six:

- ownership
- transaction transparency
- consent
- currency
- **privacy**
- **openness**

### Ownership

It's **individuals** who own the raw data they provide, and they have primary control over its usage, how it's processed and how it's shared.

### Transaction transparency

All **data processing activities and algorithms** should be completely **explainable and understood** by the **individual** who provides their data.

### Consent

This is an individual's right to **know explicit details** about how and why their data will be used before agreeing to provide it.

### Currency

Individuals should be aware of **financial transactions resulting** from the use of their personal data and the scale of these transactions.

### Privacy

Privacy means preserving a data subject's information and activity **any time a data transaction occurs**.

This is sometimes called information privacy or data protection.

#### Data anonymization

**Personally identifiable information**, or **PII**, is information that can be used by itself or with other data to track down a person's identity.

Data anonymization is the process of **protecting people's private or sensitive data** by eliminating that kind of information.

Typically, data anonymization involves **blanking, hashing, or masking personal information**.

A data analyst **removes personally identifying information** from a dataset.

### Openness

Openness refers to **free access, usage and sharing of data**.

- Open data must **be available as a whole**, preferably by downloading over the Internet in a convenient and modifiable form.

- Open data must be provided **under terms that allow reuse and redistribution** including the ability to use it with other datasets.

- Allow universal participation so that **anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data**.

The advantage is

- Credible databases can be **used more widely**. More importantly, all of that good data can be leveraged, shared, and combined with other data.

#### Interoperability

Interoperability is key to open data's success.

Interoperability is **the ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data**.
