## Data source

### CSV

CSV stands for comma-separated values.

A CSV file makes it easier for data analysts to:

- examine a small part of a large dataset

- import data to a new spreadsheet

- distinguish values from one another.

### Sorting and filtering

Sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize.

Filtering means showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest.

### Clean data

- Sorting data
- Removing incorrect data
- Filling in missing data
- Converting data
