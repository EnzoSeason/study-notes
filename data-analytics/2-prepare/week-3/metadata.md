# Metadata

Metadata is information that's used to **describe the data**.

There are three common types of metadata that you'll come across: **descriptive, structural, and administrative**.

- **Descriptive metadata** is metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to **identify it** at a later point in time.

- **Structural data** is metadata that indicates how a piece of data is **organized** and whether it's part of one or more than one data collection.

- **Administrative metadata** is metadata that indicates the **technical source** of a digital asset.

## Benefits

- Metadata creates **a single source of truth** by keeping things **consistent and uniform**.

- Metadata **makes data more reliable** by making sure it's **accurate, precise, relevant, and timely**.

## Metadata repository

A metadata repository is a database specifically created to store metadata.

Metadata repositories make it easier and faster to **bring together multiple sources** for data analysis. They do this by describing:

- the state and location of the metadata

- the structure of the tables inside

- how data flows through the repository.

- keep track of who accesses the metadata and when.

## Metadata management

Metadata is stored in **a single, central location** and it gives the company **standardized information** about all of its data.

### Data governance

Data governance is a process to **ensure the formal management** of a companyâ€™s data assets.

It's important to note that data governance is about more than just **standardizing terminology and procedures**. It's about **the roles and responsibilities of the people** who work with the metadata every day.
