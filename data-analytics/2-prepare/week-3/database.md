# Database

## Relational databases

### Primary key

A primary key is an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique.

A table can have **only one** primary key.

A primary key may also be constructed using **multiple columns** of a table. This type of primary key is called a **composite key**.

### Foreign key

A foreign key is a field within a table that is a primary key in another table.
