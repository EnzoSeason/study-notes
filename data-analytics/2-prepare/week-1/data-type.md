## Data classification

![data-types](./data-types.png)

As dicussed before, data can be split into **qualitative and quantitative**.

The quantitative can be classfied in 2 different types: **discrete and continuous**.

### Discrete data vs Continuous data

- Discrete data: It can be **counted** and have **a limited number of values**.

- Continuous data: It can be measured using a **timer**, and its value can be shown as **a decimal with several places**.

### Nominal data vs Ordinal data

- Nominal data: It is a type of **qualitative** data that's categorized **without a set order**.

- Ordinal data: It's a a type of **qualitative** data with **a set order or scale**.

### Internal data vs External data

The internal data that lives within a company's own systems.

### Structured data vs Unstructured data

- Structured data: It is data that's organized in a **certain format**, such as rows and columns. It's easier to **store, search and analyze**.

- Unstructured data: This is data that is **not** organized in any easily **identifiable manner**.

## Data model

Data modeling is the process of **creating diagrams** that visually represent how data is organized and structured. These visual representations are called data models.

Data model that is used for **organizing data elements** and how they relate to one another.

Data models help to **keep data consistent** and **provide a map of how data is organized**.

### Data element

They're pieces of information, such as people's names, account numbers, and addresses

### Levels of data modeling

1. **Conceptual data modeling** gives a high-level view of the data structure, such as how data interacts across an organization.

2. **Logical data modeling** focuses on the technical details of a database such as relationships, attributes, and entities.

3. **Physical data modeling** depicts how a database operates. A physical data model defines all entities and attributes used.

### Data-modeling techniques

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

  ERDs are a visual way to understand the relationship between entities in the data model.

- **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**

  UML diagrams are very detailed diagrams that describe the structure of a system by showing the system's entities, attributes, operations, and their relationships.

## Data types

A data type is a specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is.

### Data types in the spreadsheet

- Number

- String

- Boolean

### Data types in the database

- Records: rows

- Fields: columns

### Wide data vs Long data

#### Wide data

Every data subject has **a single row with multiple columns** to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.

Wide data lets you easily identify and quickly compare different columns.

It's used for:

- Creating tables and charts with a few variables about each subject

- Comparing straightforward line graphs

#### Long data

Long data is data in which each row is **one time point per subject**, so each subject will have data in **multiple rows**.

It's used for:

- Storing a lot of variables about each subject. For example, 60 years worth of interest rates for each bank

- Performing advanced statistical analysis or graphing

## Data transformation

 Data transformation is the process of changing the dataâ€™s format, structure.

Data transformation usually involves:

- Adding, copying, or replicating data

- Deleting fields or records

- Standardizing the names of variables

- Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database

- Joining one set of data with another

- Saving a file in a different format. For example, saving a spreadsheet as a comma separated values (CSV) file.

### Why transform data?

Goals for data transformation might be:

- Data **organization**: better organized data is easier to use

- Data **compatibility**: different applications or systems can then use the same data

- Data **migration**: data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another

- Data **merging**: data with the same organization can be merged together

- Data **enhancement**: data can be displayed with more detailed fields

- Data **comparison**: apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
