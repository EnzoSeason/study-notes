# Pivot table

Pivot tables make it possible to **view data in multiple ways in order to identify insights and trends**.

They can help you quickly make sense of larger data sets by **comparing metrics, performing calculations, and generating reports**. They’re also useful for answering specific questions about your data.

A pivot table has four basic parts: rows, columns, values, and filters.

- Rows: The rows of a pivot table organize and group data you select horizontally.

- Column: The columns organize and display values from your data vertically.

- Value: Values are used to **calculate and count data**.

  A **calculated field** is a new field within a pivot table that carries out certain calculations based on the values of other fields.

- Filter: The filters section of a pivot table enables you to apply filters based on specific criteria — just like filters in regular spreadsheets!
