# Observability

Monitoring is **collecting data**:

- collecting metrics
- collection logs
- Monitoring network traffic

When something goes wrong, the **alerts** are sent.

Observability is a property of the system. It enables to **understand the impact of a change quickly** once the change is made in the system.
