# Custody

## Escrow

A important DeFi primitive is the ability to **escrow or custody funds directly in a smart contract**.

It's different to centralized finance where we need to trust a custody organization, such as bank.

Escrow opens oppotunities:

- retaining fees and disbursing incentive
- token swap
- market making of a bonding curve

It has riskes, too. We need to be careful that the token can be **permanently custodied** if the contract doesn't encode mechanism for releasing the funds.
