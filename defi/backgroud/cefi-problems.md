# Problems of centralized finance

## Centralized control

Centralized banking system is highly concentrated.

## Limited access

Many people don't have bank accounts.

Many people can't get money from banks because their bussiness is too small, not profitable for banks.

## Inefficiency

The fee is high, and the duration of transaction is long.

## Lack of interoperability

The banks are siloed. It's hard to move money from bank to bank, and it's also difficult to move money from banks to outside world.

## Opacity

There is very little transparency. It's very hard to know the health of bank.

## Result of CeFi problems

- Miss the growth oppotunity

  The potential business can't have money to growth.

- Inequality of oppotunity

  All the money flow to big organization.
