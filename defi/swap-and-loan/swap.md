There are some key elements to look at.

  List of trades (size and price) that have been submitted but not yet filled.

  The volumn of most of the trades should be **small**. The distribution should be **similar daily**.

- **Spread**:

  The difference between the current market price for that asset and the price you buy or sell that asset for.

  It should be **low**.

The most popular mechanism for **DEX liquidity** is Automated Market Makers.
