# Other riskes

## DEX risk

One of the DEX risk is the **impermanent loss**. It's better to put the assets to somewhere else rather than in DEX.

Another is on-chain vs off-chain order-book.

On-chain order-book is **too costy**. And it's **vulnerable to front running** by good arbitrage bots.

Off-chain order-book is **easy to maintain** and **providing a better UX**. But it faces **regulatory compilance**.

## Custodial risk

If the **private key** of a wallet is lost, this key won't be recovered.

If the private key is exposed, the wallet is in danger.

The three types of custody are:

- self-custody

- partial custody

- third-party custody

The lack of custody has been the main reason why hedge and mutual funds couldn't invest in crypto.
