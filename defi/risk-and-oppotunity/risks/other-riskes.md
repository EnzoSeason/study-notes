# Other riskes

## DEX risk

One of the DEX risk is the **impermanent loss**. It's better to put the assets to somewhere else rather than in DEX.

Another is on-chain vs off-chain order-book.

On-chain order-book is **too costy**. And it's **vulnerable to front running** by good arbitrage bots.

Off-chain order-book is **easy to maintain** and **providing a better UX**. But it faces **regulatory compilance**.
