# Attacks

## Governance Attack

The developers can change the protocols to make them less profitable. This attack is due to **not being fully descentralized**.

The **protocol governance** is created. The users can buy the **tokens** that has been assigned **protocol governance right**. Then, the holders use these tokens to vote on protocol change.

But, there is still the risk, **51% attacks**.

For example, a hacker

1. amasses **governance token**
2. **votes to himself** 11.5 billion equity token
3. sell all of them on a descentralized exchange (DEX).

The hacker takes the profit, but the token price drops.

## Oracle attack

Oracle adds the **outside data** to the blockchain, such as market price from an exchange.

Oracle attack represents the **highest risk** to DeFi.

All on-chain oracles are vulnerable to **front-running**, and million of dollar have been lost due to the **arbitrageurs**.

What's more, the entire DeFi system will stop working if the oracle is down.
