# Scaling risk

## Blockchain Trilemma

- Decentralization
- Scalability
- Security

Tradeoffs refers to **the inability to achieve all three**. For example, the more centralized blockchains are much scalable.

## Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling centralizes all transaction processing to a **single node**.

## Horizontal Scaling (Sharding)

Opposite to Vertical scaling, Horizontal Scaling splits the processing to **serveral nodes**. (e.g. Proof of stake)
