Use .NET 7, with Linux or Windows Containers, for your containerized Docker server application when:

-   You have cross-platform needs. For example, you want to use both Linux and Windows Containers.
-   Your application architecture is based on microservices.
-   You need to start containers fast and want a small footprint per container to achieve better density or more containers per hardware unit in order to lower your costs.
