# Introduction

When we program, we need to consider:

- maintainability

  - extensibility

  - flexibility

- readability

- simplicity

- reusability

- testability

## OOP (Oriented Object Programming)

It's a popular coding style.

It has many useful feature, such as **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism**.

It's the foundation of design pattern.

## Design Principles

Design principles are some **experience summaries** that guide our code design.

We need to grasp the **original intention of its design**, what programming problems it can solve, and what application scenarios it has.

- SOLID:

  - Single-responsibility principle:

    A class or module should have a single responsibility.

  - Openâ€“closed principle:
    Open for extension, closed for modification.

## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are the solutions or design ideas that are summarized for some design problems often encountered in software development.

Most design patterns have to solve the problem of **code scalability**.

The difficulty of learning is to understand what problems they can solve, master **typical application scenarios**, and know how to not over-apply.

## Programming specification

It mainly solves the problem of **code readability**.

## Refactoring

It keeps the **code quality**. We need **Design Principles** and **Design Patterns** to refactor codes.
