# Process Oriented Programming vs Object Oriented Programming

## Process Oriented Programming

Like OOP, POP is a coding style.

It's based on the **functions**. It's good at dealing with a process.


## Advantages of OOP

- In application, the processes are crossed, one depends on another. POP is not good at it, while OOP solves this problems.

- OOP has **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism**, which help us maintain the application.
