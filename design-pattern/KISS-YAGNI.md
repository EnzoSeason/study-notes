# KISS & YAGNI

## KISS

Keep It Simple and Stupid.

An important means to keep the code **readable and maintainable**.

In practice:

- Do not use techniques that colleagues may not understand to implement code.

- Don't reinvent the wheel, and be good at **using existing tool libraries**.

- Don't over-optimize, which makes codes hard to read.

## YAGNI

You Ain’t Gonna Need It.

- Don't design features that you don't currently use.
- Don't write code that you don't currently use.
