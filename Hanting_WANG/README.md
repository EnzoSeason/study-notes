# How to use study mode

## Notify in the slack

Once you make a `push` on the `main` branch, a notification will be send in the slack channel, **study note**. 

It helps other members know your works.

## Add markdown files

The markdown file added under the **current folder** will be published on the website [https://seasonliu.com/station/topics](https://seasonliu.com/station/topics). For example, this README is published.

However, the markdown file under the **subfolder** of the current folder won't be published.
