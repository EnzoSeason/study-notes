# Kafaka

## Core Concepts

- **Broker**: A **server** that receives, stores, processes, and distributes events

- **Topic**: the **container** or **database** of events


- **Producer**: a kafaka client that **publishes** events into topics

- **Consumer**: a kafaka client that **subscribes** to topics and **reads** from them.
